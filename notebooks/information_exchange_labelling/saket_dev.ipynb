', \"[MOD]: I'm going to ask you three questions and I would li \", '[SPK2]: mhmm ', '[MOD]: ke you to to that were posed to group of one hundred pend one hundred people and then I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions. ', '[SPK2]: Ok ', \"[MOD]: and then we'll ask you to identify the ranking in terms of popularity. For example if I ask you what is normally used to to transport patients in a hospital you could say th things like ambulance, a wheelchair right? A patient's bed so is that is that clear? Do you have any ques \", '[SPK1]: Ok ', '[MOD]: tions? Nope? Ok. ', '[MOD]: Are you ready for the first question? ', '[SPK2]: mhmm ', '[MOD]: I have yeah I have to point out that you really need to talk to each other before you make your final decisions so you nee ', '[SPK1]: Ok. ', '[MOD]: d to have a discussion, ok? ', '[SPK1]: Right. ', '[MOD]: Right. So the first question i s where in which public place would you be more likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. ', '[SPK2]: A flu bag? ', \"[MOD]: A flu bug Sorry I'm not pronouncing \", '[SPK2]: Oh bug ok. ', '[MOD]: Bug ', '[SPK2]: Sorry . ', '[MOD]: sorry. ', '[SPK1]: Which pu ', '[SPK2]: Hm. ', '[MOD]: Ex ', '[SPK1]: blic place ', '[MOD]: Yes. ', '[SPK2]: ok Ok. ', '[SPK1]: A doct ', '[SPK2]: So ', \"[SPK1]: or's waiting room is that public? \", '[SPK2]: ', \"[SPK2]: I guess it is yeah so that makes sense somewhere where there's just a lot of people and possibly outdoors so something like a park. \", '[SPK1]: Yeah. ', '[SPK2]: So ', '[SPK1]: Or a public school would they count? Are they kind of indoors? ', \"[SPK2]: Yeah actually I think a school would be better again it's real \", '[SPK1]: yeah ', '[SPK2]: close together and stuff. ', '[SPK1]: Good. ', '[SPK2]: ', \"[SPK2]: and I'm just thinking I've a friend who got sick lately \", \"[SPK2]: after working in a restaurant but I don't think people generally get sick in restaurants. \", '[SPK1]: Well Depends on the kind ', '[SPK2]: ', '[SPK1]: of restaurant ', '[MOD]: ', '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[SPK1]: ', '[SPK2]: ', \"[SPK1]: Yeah that's kinda tricky how you should it \", '[SPK2]: Yeah ', '[SPK1]: As is is there are there any parameters going from it like does it have to be an open public pla ce or ', '[MOD]: Not really. ', '[SPK2]: Ok. ', '[SPK1]: Ok. ', '[SPK2]: what like ', '[SPK1]: Maybe ', '[SPK2]: a swimming pool be a weird answer or would it make sense? ', '[SPK1]: Would that make infections and things like that for the m like ', '[SPK2]: Yeah ', '[SPK1]: funguses and toe things and Awful stuff like that. ', '[SPK2]: Yeah exactly. ', \"[SPK1]: Yeah that was tricky. I I'd say school because everyone is always getting sick at school. \", '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', \"[SPK1]: Or anywhere you're working in close proximity to someone. \", '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[SPK1]: But ', \"[SPK2]: Me too though I think the doctor's waiting room is a pretty good one \", '[SPK2]: and then a school and then ', '[SPK1]: Ah yeah ', '[SPK2]: like a a bus like public transport. ', '[SPK1]: Awh yeah Sorry I I just touched a bus on the way here and it was so slimy it was gross yeah ', '[SPK2]: Gross ', '[SPK1]: So a bus would be a good one. ', '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[SPK1]: Alright. ', \"[SPK2]: Ok we say that that's a good three \", '[SPK1]: fair enough ', '[SPK2]: in that case? ', '[SPK1]: ok which is the most popular though? ', '[SPK2]: I think ', '[MOD]: Before you can I ', '[SPK1]: Oh ', '[MOD]: give you my feedback? Before ', '[SPK1]: Yes ', '[MOD]: you decide ', '[SPK1]: absolutely ', \"[MOD]: do you know about the ranking very good you have the two right? So it's the \", '[SPK1]: ', '[MOD]: school ', '[SPK1]: ok ', '[SPK2]: mhmm ', \"[MOD]: and then it's the next one you mentioned the doctor's waiting room can you mention something similar? \", '[MOD]: ', '[SPK1]: Like a hospital waiting room ', '[MOD]: Exactly. Great. ', '[SPK2]: Ok. ', '[MOD]: So a hospital is the second one and ', '[SPK2]: ok ', \"[MOD]: the third one again well done it's a means of trans port but it's not the b b the bus it's \", '[MOD]: a different mean ', '[SPK1]: hmm ', '[MOD]: s of transport ', '[SPK2]: Is it ', '[SPK2]: Is it still public transport? ', \"[MOD]: We ll it's a means of transportation yes it i righ it is I suppose. \", '[SPK2]: Ok. ', '[MOD]: ', '[SPK2]: Are these people asked in Ireland or ', '[SPK1]: exactly would it be the luas or ', '[SPK2]: would it be New Yorkers saying the subway or something you know ', \"[MOD]: No it's not the subway. \", '[SPK2]: ok ', '[SPK2]: ', '[SPK2]: The ', \"[SPK1]: I don't know I think it's like the bus the luas the dart \", '[SPK2]: Yeah the train ', \"[MOD]: You're ge \", '[SPK1]: the luas ', \"[MOD]: tting there you're very close \", '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: ', \"[SPK1]: taxis like Dublin bikes cause I don't know \", '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: Yeah but what is ', \"[SPK2]: I don't \", '[MOD]: the one thing that Irish people love to do How ', '[SPK1]: Complain? ', '[MOD]: do they travel ', '[SPK1]: Oh sorry ', '[SPK2]: that ', '[SPK1]: was under there ', '[MOD]: ', '[SPK2]: ', '[SPK1]: one of our own cars walking ', '[SPK1]: not walking ', '[SPK2]: it makes sen nse to say in your own car though ', \"[SPK1]: That's not public \", \"[SPK2]: but it's a public place \", '[MOD]: When people love to escape for fo from Ireland right they want ', '[SPK1]: Oh pla ane of course the recycled ', '[SPK2]: Oh plane ', '[MOD]: Excellent ', '[SPK1]: air! and ', '[SPK2]: Ye ah ', '[SPK1]: Jesus ', '[MOD]: Well done ', '[SPK1]: So hard ', '[SPK2]: ', '[SPK1]: Took us long enough. ', '[MOD]: Now that you have the three most pop ular answers would you be able to discuss the ranking then? ', '[SPK1]: Oh god ! ', '[SPK2]: Ok. ', '[SPK1]: I suppose by population the number of people that travel on planes as opposed to the people that go to school or ', '[SPK2]: Yeah exact I think that plane might ', \"[SPK1]: doctor's waiting room \", \"[SPK2]: be the third one because it's people who like travel all the time being like oh I hate travelling getting sick on the plane \", '[SPK1]: La di daw ', '[SPK2]: ', \"[SPK1]: What about doctor's waiting room or hospital waiting rooms? because you're already kinda \", '[MOD]: hmm ', '[SPK1]: sick in there. ', '[SPK2]: Yeah exactly like where does ', '[SPK2]: So if this is like understanding what people said ', '[SPK1]: hmm ', '[SPK2]: like your mind went to waiting room before it went ', '[SPK1]: ah well ', '[SPK2]: to ', \"[SPK1]: ugh it's just the super bugs and stuff yeah \", '[SPK2]: schools yeah ', '[SPK2]: so ', '[SPK1]: ', '[SPK2]: and ag gain if you seen that this is adults talking more adults have probably been to a hospital or whatever lately than ', '[SPK1]: I ', '[SPK2]: to a school so ', \"[SPK1]: You did tell us the order there though didn't you? \", '[MOD]: I will give you the order at the e nd ', '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: If ', '[SPK1]: Yeah ', '[MOD]: you can make your final decision then I can give you mine feedback yeah. ', '[SPK2]: Ok. ', '[MOD]: So what do you ', '[SPK1]: I ', '[MOD]: think ', \"[SPK1]: I remember you you just said it like five seconds ago and I don't remember it now \", '[SPK2]: ', '[SPK1]: You did the did you just say ', \"[SPK2]: I think she was just saying what they were. She didn't give the order \", \"[SPK1]: Oh I thought you said this I thought you said the third one was and the second one was but maybe it wasn't the order ok. \", \"[MOD]: No no it wasn't \", '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: the order ', '[SPK1]: I was like darn I missed the answers ', '[SPK2]: She was just saying what they were ', '[SPK1]: ok ', '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: Not giving you any hints now ', '[SPK1]: ', '[SPK1]: ', '[SPK2]: ', '[SPK1]: Ok so would you say ', '[SPK1]: hos ', '[SPK2]: I would poss ibly go hospital and then school and then plane. ', '[SPK1]: and then plane. Grand. ', '[SPK2]: Ok. ', '[SPK1]: ', '[MOD]: Is that your final decision yep? ', '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[SPK1]: Final answer. ', '[MOD]: ok now the first option is actually the school ', '[SPK2]: Ok. ', \"[MOD]: You mentioned adults there but don't forget that adults have families and they have kids. \", '[SPK2]: They do. ', '[MOD]: So s ', '[SPK2]: Yeah ', '[MOD]: The school is number one hospital is number two and the airplane is number three. But ', '[SPK2]: ok ', '[MOD]: Great, good job, very good. ', '[MOD]: Are you ready for the second question now? ', '[SPK2]: Yeah ', '[SPK1]: Ok ', '[MOD]: Great. ', '[SPK1]: ', '[MOD]: So I would like you to think about instruments what are the most popular answers to name the question of naming an instrument in an in a symphony orchestra. ', '[SPK1]: Oh ah just name? ', '[SPK2]: Just an orchestra. ', '[MOD]: In a symphony orchestra ', '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: or what are the instruments ', '[SPK1]: Violins ', '[SPK2]: so violin yeah ', '[SPK1]: ', '[SPK2]: most popular one ', '[MOD]: ', \"[SPK1]: I don't cello based o based all the other strings flutes \", '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[SPK2]: ', \"[SPK1]: I don't know a symphony orchestra. I'm terrible at those. It's just a mini orchestra \", '[SPK2]: There was a map of ', \"[SPK2]: all the things in a symphony ochestra in my school and I'm trying to think of it \", '[SPK1]: ', '[SPK2]: now. ', \"[MOD]: Well you've already got the two. \", '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[SPK1]: Oh oh there you go. so what do I say? ', '[MOD]: So ', '[SPK2]: Violins and cellos is it? ', '[MOD]: Exactly. ', '[SPK1]: Ok. ', '[SPK1]: as are there symbols and are those things that crash ', '[SPK2]: ', '[SPK1]: together? ', '[SPK2]: Basically like a symbol or a drum or something ', '[SPK1]: Yeah. What are those yolks called ', '[MOD]: hmm ', '[SPK1]: with the monkeys ', '[MOD]: You did find the third one ', '[SPK2]: The drum? ', '[MOD]: Yes! Exactly. ', '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[MOD]: Well done. ', '[SPK2]: Cool. ', '[SPK1]: There you go. ', \"[MOD]: You're very good. So \", '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: What with the right or the ranking in terms of popularity. ', '[SPK2]: ok I think violin would be number one ', '[SPK1]: Yeah we both came to it first ', '[SPK2]: in a big way. ', '[SPK1]: to it first. ', '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', \"[SPK1]: Then it's cellos? \", '[SPK1]: or drums maybe. ', \"[SPK2]: I don't know I think that was or I don't know the kinda default thing that you think of with the symphony orchestra is like duh duh duh duh duh you know that starts with like the start of \", '[SPK1]: ', '[SPK2]: universal ', '[SPK1]: Yeah ', '[SPK2]: movies you know the dun dun dun dun dun. ', '[SPK1]: oh so the drums? ', '[SPK2]: so people might go to drums ', '[SPK1]: ok ', \"[SPK2]: then second I don't \", '[SPK1]: ', \"[SPK2]: know it's just a way of thinking of it \", '[SPK1]: maybe ', '[SPK2]: yeah. ', '[SPK1]: We go with that then? ', '[SPK1]: the violin, drums, cello ', '[SPK1]: Ok ', '[SPK2]: Yeah. ', '[SPK2]: Think so. ', '[MOD]: mhmm Ok? ', '[SPK2]: Yeah ', '[SPK1]: mhmm ', \"[MOD]: you were very fast when you had to find the three answers but I'm afraid you again don't have the right ranking. \", '[SPK2]: ', '[MOD]: It was the violin then the cello. ', '[SPK1]: oh ', '[MOD]: and the drum was the third ', '[SPK2]: Ok. ', '[MOD]: last one but good great work.
